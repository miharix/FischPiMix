!!! Waring dont build this circuit if you dont know how to fix it !!!

This circuit version contains at least 2 known bugs:

1. Battery polarity protection is wrong -> connect batery wrong and your Raspbery Pi is for trash !

2. RsPi GPIO protection against wrong direction has a little bit to big rezistors (for RsPi specification) in special cases it could draw to much mA for RsPi GPIO
